# Postgres issue

Problem #1 : By default postgres does not have any db password set on ubuntu. Now apparently this is an  issue while conencting to the database 

FAIL: TestNonExistentUser (0.01s)
	/home/tg/go/src/github.com/leagueauctions/server/usermgmt/test/model_test.go:48: pq: password authentication failed for user "postgres"

Solution for problem #1 :

change postgres user password. this is sorta required to connect to league auction database and access tables 
inside psql prompt
>> ALTER USER postgres PASSWORD 'newPassword';

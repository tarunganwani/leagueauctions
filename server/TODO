Issues to be addressed

0. CLient side handshakes and certificte exchange -POSTMAN can be used as a client
    Right now post man has been configured to ignore certificates(settings> general)

1. Server errors emitted on https request
2020/05/16 18:00:18 http: TLS handshake error from [::1]:47718: tls: first record does not look like a TLS handshake
2020/05/16 18:00:19 http: TLS handshake error from [::1]:47722: tls: first record does not look like a TLS handshake
2020/05/16 18:00:41 http2: server: error reading preface from client [::1]:47726: remote error: tls: bad certificate
2020/05/16 18:00:41 http2: server: error reading preface from client [::1]:47728: remote error: tls: bad certificate

2. CORS 
handlers.AllowedOrigins allows all remote origins("*") right now. check if this is okay.

3. Server Logging

4. SSL Certificate 
 For Dev we are using self signed certs and bypassing all the security checks in android
